            <p>One thing I ask:
<br>
<br>
        To dwell in the house of the Lord all my days,
<br>
        To gaze on His goodness
<br>
        And walk in His ways.
<br>
<br>

        He will shelter me;
<br>
        He will be my strength.
<br>
        In the triumph that He brings me
<br>        
        I can hold my head high.
<br>
<br>

        In His house I shall lift up my voice.
<br>    
        I will sing, I will praise the Lord.</p>
